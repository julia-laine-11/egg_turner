# Why??

Hi!

My name is Julia and I used to always want to be a vet. During COVID we were all slightly less sane by being trapped at home, so like any normal person I hatched quail so I could pursue veterinary. (Spoiler, this is not where I ended up!)

*my quail during online school*

I chose quail because I lived in a city and the laws prohibited poultry, but quail were explicitly listed as gamebirds and not prohibited in the federal, state, county, or city laws - and therefore legal. I reseached their needs, how to incubate them, and everything I could possibly know about them. Afterwards, I ordered the eggs and bought a Little Giant incubator (looking back, I should have just made my own). I ordered 12 but the seller sent 28 (which was quite shocking).

I also built them their own house (my own design, with my dad's help with power tools :) )
