### Prep for incubation

I secured the egg turner to the ground of the incubator to test it before the new eggs arrived. I replaced the piece of paper with another printed piece, I don't know why it is like that in this image.

Once the eggs arrived, I loaded them into the egg turner (after washing my hands of course) and turned it on. I programmed it to sit at 45 degrees and gently turn 90 degrees to the opposite 45 degrees every 4 hours.

### Hatch day (from the batch that used my egg turner)

I had a high hatch rate (I do not remember the exact percentage, but I think it was around 60-70% [which is really good for shipped eggs](https://cowboycoop406.com/hatchingguide/#:~:text=You%20can%20expect%20an%20average,hatch%20rate%20with%20shipped%20eggs.))

Hatch day came:

## Results

Overall, this project got me into electrical engineering. I got super interested in coding and electronics after I wired up and programmed the servo. I also started using Fusion360 for CAD since it is free for students. I tried to make a drone but that low-key failed because I didn't know what I was doing and I wasn't passionate enough about the drone to put in the hours to research.

- The gyro was off center
- The drone was super heavy
- My tolerances weren't the best so the gears slipped occasinally

I took my failures as a learning experience and I moved on to the robot dog when I saw the files of it online.

I still love my quail, even though I no longer want to be a vet. Unfortunately, all of them have passed since they were very very old for quail. They all lived about 3 or 4 years. I don't think I would have been in engineering if not for them.
