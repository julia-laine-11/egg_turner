## Changes I would make 

Like any project, this one can definitely be improved. It does work and it was incredibly cheap to make, but I did have some issues.

### Larger egg holders

One issue I had was the eggs had to be carefully placed in since the holes were super small and shallow. If I made this again (which I will if I hatch more eggs after college), I would make the holes larger and deeper. I have no interest in hatching larger birds, but if I did I would also have to make different holders for those. A solution for this would be to make large holes for chicken eggs, and inserts for quail eggs. Keeping it just for quail eggs lets me easily store it and fit more eggs in the same container.

### Larger feet

Another issue I had was it was zip tied to the ground, so on day 15 (the day you stop rotating the eggs) I had to take all of them out to cut the zip ties. This was probably not the best since the membrane inside can shrink wrap the chick if it gets cold and/or dry while outside of the incubator. I could easily fix this by making the feet on the base larger, although it would cut down on how easily I can store it.

### Good things

Other than those two, I really liked how I added an LED to show it was running, even though it was still. I could add a binary counter of the amount of times it has rotated.

Also, the chicks are super cute!
