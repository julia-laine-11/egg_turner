## My egg turner
Since there were so many eggs, I started making my own egg turner. 

### Cardboard circle

*(Left: Lego Mindstorm, Right: my janky circle egg turner)*

I cut a circle piece of cardboard. The floor of the incubator is a plastic grid so I used lego pieces to secure the center so it could rotate around its center. 4 triangles were cut into it so the eggs could lay on their sides and spin as the wheel spun.

It rotated by using a Lego Mindstorm motor and a Lego wheel. 

Problems with cardboard spinning wheel:
  - Remember how incubators have to stay humid? Yeah. Cardboard doesn't like humidity. The cardboard became soft in the incubator.

### Plexiglass circle

I fixed this by making it out of plexiglass. Same shape as the cardboard, just different material and new/different problems:
  - It took up a lot of space and could not turn a lot of eggs
  - It also shook them a little bit more than I liked

### Standing egg turner

I fixed these new problems by learning how to use CAD to make my own designs to 3D print. I made my own egg turner design using Tinkercad. And yeah it's not the best, we all start somewhere though and this was my first CAD experience. 

I printed the file and used an Arduino to program it this time. I had no clue what I was doing. It was my first time using a breadboard, Arduino, or C++. I learned all the basics through reading the Arduino sample codes. Controlling a servo seemed easy enough. I learned about importing, code structure, loops, sending signals, and semicolons semicolons semicolons.

All the egg turner used was an Arduino, my files, an SG-90 servo, and zip-ties (of course).

*My first time using a breadboard. I was home alone so I sent this to my dad because I was so proud I figured it out*

By the time I got the new egg turner working, the first round of quail had already hatched.

*My first batch of babies*

I let the first batch grow up some and then I hatched their children. They only take 6-8 weeks to lay eggs. They only live [a few years in the wild](https://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Coturnix_japonica#:~:text=AnAge%20entry%20for%20Coturnix%20japonica&text=The%20Japanese%20quail%20displays%20a,%2D3%20years%20%5B0028%5D.) so they have to become adults quickly. I don't have the site but I read that if you don't raise quail with other colors of quail then they will be aggressive towards the new color. I was worried all of the new batch would be brown since it is the dominant gene so I ordered a small batch from the same seller.

*This is Sand. She is named that because she loved sand. Old world quail (these guys) are from a more deserty area so they bathe in sand instead of water*
