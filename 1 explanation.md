# Why??

Hi!

My name is Julia and I used to always want to be a vet. During COVID we were all slightly less sane by being trapped at home, so like any normal person I hatched quail so I could pursue veterinary. (Spoiler, this is not where I ended up!)

*my quail during online school*

I chose quail because I lived in a city and the laws prohibited poultry, but quail were explicitly listed as gamebirds and not prohibited in the federal, state, county, or city laws - and therefore legal. I reseached their needs, how to incubate them, and everything I could possibly know about them. Afterwards, I ordered the eggs and bought a Little Giant incubator (looking back, I should have just made my own). I ordered 12 but the seller sent 28 (which was quite shocking).

I also built them their own house (my own design, with my dad's help with power tools :) )

# Incubation

## General Incubation needs:

- During incubation, [eggs must be rotated to keep the chicks healthy](https://www.brinsea.com/t-turningeggs.aspx). Touching the eggs can introduce problems though, like [introducing bacteria or shaking the chicks too much](https://incubatorwarehouse.com/pages/incubating-eggs-hard-questions). 
- The incubator must stay at [99.5 F or 37.5 C](https://www.southwestgamebirds.com/raising-quail/#:~:text=Incubation,fuse%20to%20the%20albumin%20membrane.)
- The humidity must stay around [50% humidity for most of the incubation](https://www.southwestgamebirds.com/raising-quail/#:~:text=Incubating%20Coturnix%20Eggs%3A,see%20how%20much%20they%20change.), then get raised before hatching.
- A still air incubator is just an incubator without a fan. Fans are needed to move the air around so there is even heating and humidity. I had a still air incubator, but I added a fan on my own.

## My eggs

The eggs had to be turned 3 times a day. All 28 of them. This was super tedious (and also scary since I was so nervous about hurting them!) since there were so many eggs and I had to do it both quickly (so I didn't let the hot air out) and carefully so I didn't hurt the eggs.

To add to this, 12 more eggs showed up. I still don't know why, but there were so many eggs in the incubator and it was really crazy.

*My incubator set up. It did not come with a fan, so I installed my own with pipe cleaners to avoid getting hot spots inside.*

With this many eggs, I immediately thought "how can I make this more efficient" because it was a super easy but repetitive task. I knew I could automate it.
